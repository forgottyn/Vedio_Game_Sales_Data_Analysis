## Introduction

There are so many games on the market. Thus, game players have various choices. I'd like to draw insights from publisher sides. Specifically, I want to find answers for these two following questions:

- What makes a video game the best seller?
- Why the second best publisher didn't become the best one?

With these questions, I started my analysis. 

## Dataset

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019) I use this the one containing video games sales data till April 2019. The contributor described it as:

> There are 55,792 records in the dataset as of April 12th, 2019. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

Variables I will use would be:

- Platform - Platform of the game (i.e. PC, PS4, XOne, etc.)
- Genre - Genre of the game
- Publisher - Publisher of the game
- Developer - Developer of the game
- Total Shipped - Total shipped copies of the game
