# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Intro

Specifically, I want to find answers for these two following questions:

- What makes a video game the best seller?
- Why the second best publisher didn't become the best one?

With these questions, I started my analysis. 

## What makes a video game the best seller?

I did research on this question from years, genre, platform, publisher and developer. First let's check on years.

### Year

Turns out games released between 2005 to 2013 have the highest sells, and at peak when in 2009. This is not surprising because games before this period may be out of style, but games after this period need to take the test of time. This could give game developers an insight - **if you want to build a best seller game, target it as a 10 year winner rather than just an eye-catcher for 6 months**. Following trends without thinking won't make a game time legend. 

### Genre & Platform

There are four genres that sells more than 1 billions (shipment are calculated in millions). These four genres are:

- Action          1496.12
- Sports          1464.10
- Shooter         1340.85
- Role-Playing    1142.91

In terms of platform, PS2 is the first and way more than the second, pc, following by X360, PS3 AND Wii. Congratulations, Sony. 

### Publisher

When I saw these two graphs, I doubted whether the data was correct(it was scraped from game website, so I believe we can assume it's correct). It's not surprised that Nintendo, Activision and Electronic Arts are top 3. What surprise me is that Nintendo is way more than the second and third. Copies sold by Nintendo is even more than sum of that sold by Activision, Electronic Arts and Sony. 

Thus, the second question come to my mind - why Activision didn't become Nintendo? What makes the difference? In the second part, I would analyze the difference of Activision and Nintendo.

## Why the second best publisher didn't become the best one?

### Number

First, I would like to know how many games were published separately by Activision and Nintendo. Turns out that while Activision has 1027 games published, Nintendo only has 753 ones. Meanwhile, out of Top 10 best seller games, Nintendo has 8. 

| Rank | Name                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Wii Sports                         |
| 2    | Super Mario Bros                   |
| 3    | Mario Kart Wii                     |
| 5    | Wii Sports Resort                  |
| 6    | Pokemon Red / Green / Blue Version |
| 7    | New Super Mario Bros               |
| 8    | Tetris                             |
| 9    | New Super Mario Bros. Wii          |

From this part, we could learn:

- comparing to having hundreds of games, several game point games could bring more profits to the company. 
- Even though, Nintendo still has 753 games. 

### Genre

| Rank | Activision | Nintendo     | Total        |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1    | Shooter    | Platform     | Action       |
| 2    | Action     | Role-Playing | Sports       |
| 3    | Sports     | Sports       | Shooter      |
| 4    | Misc       | Misc         | Role-Playing |
| 5    | Platform   | Racing       | Platform     |

This chart summaries number of sells by genre for Activision, Nintendo and all companies. What interesting is that comparing to Nintendo, Activision's top 5 best seller genre is more similar to that of all companies. 

I guess it's reasonable to follow which genre is hot in market generally (Nintendo is not totally different from the market). But if just following, Nintendo would make more action games, thus it may not be the Top 1 companies. 

**For everything company, there is a fine line of following trend and keeping advantages.** Clearly, Nintendo has found its one. 

## Summary

Through my analysis process, I found out that this dataset is not enough to find answers for my questions, especially the second one. But still, I found some insights of the game industry. Game is workpieces combing art, technology and business. Thus simply using one angle to develop strategy is definitely not enough.
